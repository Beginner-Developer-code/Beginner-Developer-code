## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student, in my free time i like coding, resolve the rubick cube and go to gym.

I enjoy working in web development using fundamental technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with frameworks such as React and Angular for the frontend, and PHP and Python for the backend. Constantly learning and improving through hands-on experience, I love collaborating with other developers to build tools that make a real difference.
